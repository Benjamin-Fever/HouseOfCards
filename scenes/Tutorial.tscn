This is a game of skill and luck. 
You will draw cards, either to yourself or your opponent. If the card is a Joker, the receiving player loses a life and forfeits their turn. 
If the card is a picture card or ace, they will have special abilities, and you canâ€¦.. These will be explained when you receive them. 
Lastly, if you get any card from 2 to 9, you will begin to build your house of cards.

Winning:
Whichever player's health reaches 0 first will lose.
However, if you are able to build your house of cards before either player's health reaches 0, you will get a true victory.

You will have 15 seconds to look at the deck and best memorise what is in it. 
Make your best judgment on what you should do on your turn based on what has already been drawn, and good luck!
